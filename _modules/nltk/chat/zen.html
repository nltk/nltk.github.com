<span class="sd">Zen Chatbot talks in gems of Zen wisdom.</span>

<span class="sd">This is a sample conversation with Zen Chatbot:</span>
<span class="sd">ZC:    Welcome, my child.</span>
<span class="sd">me:    Good afternoon.</span>
<span class="sd">ZC:    Ask the question you have come to ask.</span>
<span class="sd">me:    How can I achieve enlightenment?</span>
<span class="sd">ZC:    How do you suppose?</span>
<span class="sd">me:    Through meditation.</span>
<span class="sd">ZC:    Form is emptiness, and emptiness form.</span>
<span class="sd">me:    How can I empty my mind of worldly troubles?</span>
<span class="sd">ZC:    Will an answer to that really help in your search for enlightenment?</span>
<span class="sd">me:    Yes.</span>
<span class="sd">ZC:    It is better to be right than to be certain.</span>
<span class="sd">me:    I seek truth and wisdom.</span>
<span class="sd">ZC:    The search for truth is a long journey.</span>
<span class="sd">me:    Are you sure?</span>
<span class="sd">ZC:    Maybe sure, maybe not sure.</span>


<span class="sd">The chatbot structure is based on that of chat.eliza. Thus, it uses</span>
<span class="sd">a translation table to convert from question to response</span>
<span class="sd">i.e. &quot;I am&quot; --&gt; &quot;you are&quot;</span>

<span class="sd">Of course, since Zen Chatbot does not understand the meaning of any words,</span>
<span class="sd">responses are very limited. Zen Chatbot will usually answer very vaguely, or</span>
<span class="sd">respond to a question by asking a different question, in much the same way</span>
<span class="sd">as Eliza.</span>
