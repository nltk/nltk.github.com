<dt>Version 0.9.9 released: May 2009</dt><dd><p>This version finalizes NLTK’s API ahead of the 2.0 release and the publication of the NLTK book.  There have been dozens of minor enhancements and bugfixes.  Many names of the form nltk.foo.Bar are now available as nltk.Bar.  There is expanded functionality in the decision tree, collocations, and Toolbox modules.  A new translation toy nltk.misc.babelfish has been added.  A new module nltk.help gives access to tagset documentation.  Fixed imports so NLTK will build and install without Tkinter (for running on servers).  New data includes a maximum entropy chunker model and updated grammars.  NLTK Contrib includes updates to the coreference package (Joseph Frazee) and the ISRI Arabic stemmer (Hosam Algasaier).  The book has undergone substantial editorial corrections ahead of final publication.  For full details see the ChangeLog.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version 0.9.8 released: February 2009</dt><dd><p>This version contains a new off-the-shelf tokenizer, POS tagger, and named-entity tagger.  A new metrics package includes inter-annotator agreement scores and various distance and word association measures (Tom Lippincott and Joel Nothman).  There’s a new collocations package (Joel Nothman).  There are many improvements to the WordNet package and browser (Steven Bethard, Jordan Boyd-Graber, Paul Bone), and to the semantics and inference packages (Dan Garrette).  The NLTK corpus collection now includes the PE08 Parser Evaluation data, and the CoNLL 2007 Basque and Catalan Dependency Treebanks.  We have added an interface for dependency treebanks.  Many chapters of the book have been revised in response to feedback from readers.  For full details see the ChangeLog.  NB some method names have been changed for consistency and simplicity.  Use of old names will generate deprecation warnings that indicate the correct name to use.</p>

<dt>NLTK-Lite 0.9 released: October 2007</dt><dd><p>This version is substantially revised and expanded from version 0.8. The entire toolkit can be accessed via a single import statement “import nltk”, and there is a more convenient naming scheme. Calling deprecated functions generates messages that help programmers update their code. The corpus, tagger, and classifier modules have been redesigned. All functionality of the old NLTK 1.4.3 is now covered by NLTK-Lite 0.9. The book has been revised and expanded. A new data package incorporates the existing corpus collection and contains new sections for pre-specified grammars and pre-computed models. Several new corpora have been added, including treebanks for Portuguese, Spanish, Catalan and Dutch. A Macintosh distribution is provided. For full details see the ChangeLog.</p>
