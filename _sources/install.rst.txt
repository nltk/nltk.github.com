Installing NLTK
===============

NLTK requires Python versions 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 or 3.11.

For Windows users, it is strongly recommended that you go through this guide to install Python 3 successfully https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/win/#install3-windows

Setting up a Python Environment (Mac/Unix/Windows)
--------------------------------------------------

Please go through this guide to learn how to manage your virtual environment managers before you install NLTK,  https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/

Alternatively, you can use the Anaconda distribution installer that comes "batteries included" https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

Mac/Unix
--------

#. Install NLTK: run ``pip install --user -U nltk``
#. Install Numpy (optional): run ``pip install --user -U numpy``
#. Test installation: run ``python`` then type ``import nltk``

For older versions of Python it might be necessary to install setuptools (see https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) and to install pip (``sudo easy_install pip``).

Windows
-------

These instructions assume that you do not already have Python installed on your machine.

32-bit binary installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Install Python 3.8: https://www.python.org/downloads/ (avoid the 64-bit versions)
#. Install Numpy (optional): https://numpy.org/install/
#. Install NLTK: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nltk
#. Test installation: ``Start>Python38``, then type ``import nltk``

Installing Third-Party Software
-------------------------------

Please see: https://github.com/nltk/nltk/wiki/Installing-Third-Party-Software


Installing NLTK Data
-------------------------------

After installing the NLTK package, please do install the necessary datasets/models for specific functions to work.

If you're unsure of which datasets/models you'll need, you can install the "popular" subset of NLTK data, on the command line type ``python -m nltk.downloader popular``, or in the Python interpreter ``import nltk; nltk.download('popular')``

For details, see https://www.nltk.org/data.html
